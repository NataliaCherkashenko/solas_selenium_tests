# SeleniumAutomationFramework

Example skeleton for quick start with Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.

## Dependencies
- Java
- Maven
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG
- WebDriverManager

## Built with this in mind
- Page object pattern
- WebDriver factory with all major browsers supported
- Page factory provided by WebDriver
- Readability and scalability

## Improvements
- Test methods can return itself for easy chaining
- Generic class for invoking getPage static method for creating new page instance. Probably using Reflection
- Reporting API or TestNG build in reports
- Using spreadsheets to read data for input
- Using Selenium IDE and Selenesse (pure html scripts)
- Generators
- Logging with Log4j
